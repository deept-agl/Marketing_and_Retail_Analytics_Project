## 🚀 Project Overview

Two datasets from an automobile parts company and a grocery store are analyzed:

### **Milestone 1 — RFM Customer Segmentation**
Dataset of **2,747 transactions** containing customer, product, pricing, and sales information.  
Objectives:
- Explore sales trends (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly)
- Identify best customers, loyal buyers, lost customers, and churn-risk groups
- Compute **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** scores for segmentation
- Build a segmentation workflow using **KNIME**
- Create insights dashboards using **Tableau**

### **Milestone 2 — Market Basket Analysis**
Dataset of **20,641 grocery transactions** with product and order details.  
Objectives:
- Identify frequently bought‐together products
- Use **Support**, **Confidence**, and **Lift** to build association rules
- Recommend high-impact product bundles
- Provide insights to improve sales and customer engagement

## 📊 Key Insights

### **From RFM Segmentation**
- **Best Customers:** High RFM scores (e.g., Euro Shopping Channel, Anna’s Decorations)  
- **Lost Customers:** Very low RFM scores (e.g., Auto-Moto Classics Inc.)  
- **At-Risk Customers:** Medium–low recency scores  
- **Top Cities:** Madrid (Spain) leads in total sales  
- **Best Product Line:** Classic Cars generates maximum revenue  

### **From Market Basket Analysis**
Top association rules include:
- Poultry + Dinner Rolls  
- Eggs + Soda  
- Poultry + Yoghurt + Milk + Cheese  
- Sandwich Bags + Tortillas  
- Detergent + Mixes  

These combinations have high lift and confidence → ideal for bundling strategies.
